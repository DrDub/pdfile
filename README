The PdFile library for Pure Data static patching.
-------------------------------------------------

PdFile is a pure Python library for dealing with Pure Data files
programmatically. It enables creating and some basic understanding of
PD files from Python. With PdFile, a Python programmer can develop
complex PD patches without having to use PD's graphical interface.

This library does not require PD.
